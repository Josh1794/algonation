# Invert a Binary Tree

## Prompt
Invert a binary tree.

## Example

```js
let bstInput = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9];
invertTree(bestInput) //output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
```

## Approach
There are a few approaches to be done, possibly using DFS and recursion. The approach used here is BFS using a queue to invert first the parent branches, and then the child nodes.

# Maximum Subarray Problem

### Prompt
Create a function that takes an array of integers, and finds the contiguous subarray that has the maximum sum, and return the greatest subarray.

Create a function that takes an array of integers, and finds the contiguous subarray that has the maximum sum, and return the sum.

### Example
```js
var array = [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4];
console.log(maxSubArray(array));
//should output [ 4, -1, 2, 1 ];
```

### Approach
There are two possible problems here:
- 1 resolves the issue of finding the actual subarray.
- 1 resolves the issue of finding the maximum sum only.

The actual subarray can take the maximum sum solution incorporated.

### Solution
See `solution.js`.

### Credit/Inspiration
This was an extra in a REACTO problem at Fullstack Academy. This is my understanding of the solution.

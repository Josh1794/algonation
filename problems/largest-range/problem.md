Write a function that takes in an array of integers and returns an array of length 2 representing the largest range of numbers contained in that array. [first number, last number]
A range of numbers is defined as a set of numbers that come right after each other in the set of real integers.

```js
largestRange([1,11,3,0,15,5,2,4,10,7,12,6]); //returns [0,7]
```

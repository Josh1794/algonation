Max Sum Increasing Subsequence

Given a non-empty array of integers, write a function that returns an array of length 2. The first element in the output array should be an integer value representing the greatest sum that can be generated from a strictly-increasing subsequence in the array. The second element should be an array of the numbers in that subsequence. A subsequence is defined as a set of numbers that are not necessarily adjacent but that are int he same order as they appear in the array.

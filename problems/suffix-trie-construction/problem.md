Suffix Trie Construction

Write a class for a suffix-trie-like data structure. The class should have a "root" property set to be the root node of the trie. The class should support creation from a string and the seraching of strings. The creation method will be called when the class is first instantiated and should populate the "root" property of the class. Note that every string added to the trie should end with the special "endSymbol" character "*".

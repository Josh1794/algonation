Write a function, smallestDifference, that takes in two arrays of non-negative integers and returns an array of 2 numbers, one from each array, of which the absolute difference is closest to zero.

Example:

```js
smallestDifference([-1, 5, 10, 20, 3], [26, 134, 135, 15, 17])
//Returns [20, 17]
```
